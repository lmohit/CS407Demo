# CS407Demo

A simple Git and GitHub demo for CS 407 Fall 2021.

Steps

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account. 
(see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo to understand forking a repository)
2. "git clone" your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Use “javac Operations.java” and “java Operations.java” commands for compilation and execution of the program.
4. Modify the program to find the difference between two numbers instead of sum.
5. Run javac and java commands again to check your modifications.
6. "git add --all" to add the files you created/modified to the staging area (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add for different "git add" options and/or use the man pages!)
7. "git commit --all -m “msg”, where "msg" is whatever message you want to attach to your commit (again, either use Google or the man pages to find the different "git commit" options). Try adding a descriptive message to each commit.
8. "git push" to send your local repository changes to the remote one. Make sure you have your GitHub login credentials on hand, since it may ask for them depending on how your machine is configured.
9. Visit your repository on a web browser to see the new commits.

Extras

1. Run "git pull" if you want to update your code with what's in your repository. This might be helpful if you are on a different branch and need to pull in changes that were made on a different branch.
2. Run "git branch" and/or "git checkout" to do branch operations (like create, delete, switch to, etc.). Look at documentation online or the man pages to get specific questions answered.
3. Try to create and switch to another branch, add another Java file that does something, and merge your new branch and the master branch back together.
4. Some of the more advanced commands are reset(soft/hard), rebase, stash. Check out these commands to get a deeper understanding of Git.
	
As you use Git more often, you will inevitably run into issues. The Internet, man pages, and other humans will always help you troubleshoot these problems. Be curious and explore!
